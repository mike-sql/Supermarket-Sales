**Seasonal Trends**: Sales of Home &Lifestyle peaked in March, while Food & Beverage peaked in February


### Sales Trends

**Monthly Sales Trends**: In the first quarter, January saw the highest sales at $116,291.87, likely due to post-holiday shopping. Sales dropped to $97,219.37 in February, reflecting the typical retail slowdown and fewer days in the month. March sales rebounded to $109,455.51.

### Payment Methods

**Popular Payment Methods**: E-wallet was the most popular payment method, used in 35% of transactions, followed by cash at 34%. 
The payment method analysis reveals that 35% of transactions were made using e-wallets, making it the most popular choice among customers. Cash transactions accounted for 34%, closely following e-wallets, while credit cards were used in 31% of transactions. This distribution indicates a strong preference for digital payments among customers.

### Gross Margin Analysis

The gross profit analysis by unit price reveals that the highest profits were generated from products priced at $90 and above, totaling $5,844.62. Products priced between $60-$70 and $80-$90 followed, with gross profits of $2,957.76 and $2,579.07, respectively. The lowest gross profit came from products priced between $10-$20, which generated only $443.65. This indicates that higher-priced products contribute significantly more to gross profits.

## CONCLUSION  

Based on the analysis, here are some key takeaways and recommendations to help boost the business and keep growth on track:

**Boost Top Performers**: Branch C and City Naypyitaw are clearly leading in sales. Let’s focus on keeping that momentum by supporting them with more resources or special promotions. At the same time, it’s worth digging into what’s happening at Branch B to figure out how we can improve its performance.

**Know Your Customers**: We’re seeing that female customers tend to prefer Food & Beverages, while male customers lean more toward Health & Beauty. We can tailor our marketing to highlight these preferences and connect more effectively with our customers.

**Prioritize Best Sellers**: Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel are pulling in strong sales, so it makes sense to continue promoting and stocking these products. Health & Beauty is lagging, so we might want to rethink how we’re positioning or marketing those items.

**Leverage Seasonality**: Sales for Home & Lifestyle peak in March, while Food & Beverages peak in February. Timing promotions around these months could help maximize sales.

**Encourage Digital Payments**: E-wallets are the most popular payment method, with customers showing a strong preference for digital payments. It’s important to continue enhancing and promoting our digital payment options to match this trend.

**Focus on High-Value Products**: Products priced at $90 and above are contributing the most to profits. Focusing more on these items, whether through targeted promotions or upselling, can significantly boost profitability.
